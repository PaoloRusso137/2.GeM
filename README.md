    Please note that the workingspcae is set as the personal GOOGLE DRIVE the runner of the code
    Once we completed a training, we have download the best_model.pth, zip it and upload to the GitHub.
    In this way it was easy to run the various tests since the directories are simplyfied. Also, in this way it was not important who writed the code into Collab, since once the git gets clone, atuomatically the best_model of the refence point was downloaded as well. Of course it has to be unzipped
    Please be aware that for the TEST run, the directory were the best_model is saved could change inside the file REAL_TSET.PY, so please control it before launching a TEST!
